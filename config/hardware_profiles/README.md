Control-Tower Hardware Profiles
==============================

This directory contains the hardware profiles for each specific deployment. 
Since the serial ports change between hardware changes, this folder is useful
to help keep proper documentation and save time on deployments. The launch script 
uses this directory to pull the serial port settings from.

Currently, this is useful for telling which serial port the coordinator xbee is on.
