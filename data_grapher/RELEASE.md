# Release Notes

# v0.1.0

This is the initial release which mixes gnuplot based graphing with
matplotlib graphing. Matplotlib appears to take a long time to graph,
but it is the easiest to use.

**Limitations**

Currently the main gnuplot-based plotting engine is not working
because data is now mixed in the CSV files.

**Performance**

* Rendering 2 boxes using matplotlib and pandas from 2015-01-01 to
    2016-12-06 takes approx 171 seconds (2.85 minutes)
