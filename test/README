The following documentation denotes how to test packets with the packet_tester.py without hardware on a Linux machine.

Required materials:
	packet_tester.py and required packages to run packet_tester.py (used for testing incoming packets)
	test_data.py (used for writing preset packet to serial)
	socat (used for creating virtual serial ports)

Step 1: Install socat with the following command

	sudo apt install socat

Step 2: Run socat with the following command
	
	socat -d -d pty,link=./ttyV1,raw,echo=0 pty,link=./ttyV2,raw,echo=0

	This command allows for the use of ttyV1 and ttyV2 as virtual serial ports

Step 3: Run the test_data.py program with the following command

	python test_data.py

	The program will then prompt the user to enter the serial port being used. You will enter the following string:

		ttyV1

	The program will begin writing fake packets to the serial port

Step 4: Run the packet_tester.py program with the following command

	python packet_tester.py

	The program will then prompt the user to enter the serial port being used. You will enter the following string:

		ttyV2

	The program will begin reading the packets and outputting the result to the terminal

Step 5: Congratulations you have successfully tested packets without hardware!
